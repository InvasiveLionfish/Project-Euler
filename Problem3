def is_prime? (n)
    (2..n).each do |arg|
        if n%arg==0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end 

#Solving the Problem
# We make array of prime numbers with modulo 0
# as long as product_sum < n
def prime? n
  (2..(n-1)).each { |x| return false if n % x == 0 }
  true
end

# this is our target number
n = 600_851_475_143

a = []
product_sum = 1

# the digit 2 is the first prime number,
# so we define it in x
x = 2
 
while product_sum < n
  if n % x == 0 && prime?(x)
    a << x
    product_sum *= x
  end
  x += 1
end

# print out the solution
puts "The answer is #{a.last}"
